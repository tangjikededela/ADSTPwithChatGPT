Above is the figure of the confusion matrix.
And the cross-validation mean score of the model is {{cv}}.
As a rough guideline, that indicates {%-if cv > 0.8%} the model performance is good. {%-else%} the model performance may not be good enough. {%endif%}
However, the specific threshold for what is considered good can vary depending on the problem, dataset, and evaluation criteria.
